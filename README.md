# Live-Sudoku-Solver-using-Opencv
This project features a live 9*9 sudoku solver through an image. The program uses computer vision techniques like adaptiveThresholding, contours etc to grab the digits for the sudoku image, feeds them through a CNN classifier,
arranges the recognised digits in a matrix by maping its co-ordinate on the image to a 9*9 matrix and solves the sudoku through backtaracking algoithm.
The solved puzzle is displayed as a seperate image.
